Don’t Crash! — Processing Game

Don’t Crash! is a 2D arcade-style game developed using Processing (Java).
The objective is to control the player and avoid moving obstacles for as long as possible.
The game ends when the player collides with an obstacle.

This project was created as part of a university programming module to demonstrate object-oriented programming, collision detection, and interactive game design.

Features:
⦁	Controlled using keyboard input
⦁	Displayed using image-based sprites
⦁	Move across the screen with independent X and Y speeds
⦁	Bounce off screen edges
⦁	Spawn at intervals during gameplay
⦁	Radius-based collision logic
⦁	Ends the game when a collision occurs
⦁	Continuous rendering using draw()
⦁	Game over state handling
⦁	Custom player, obstacle, and background images

Technologies Used:
⦁	Processing (Java)
⦁	Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
⦁	ArrayLists for obstacle management
⦁	Collision detection mathematics
⦁	Keyboard input handling

How to Run the Game
1.	Download and install Processing
⦁	https://processing.org/download
2. Open assignment.pde in Processing
3. Ensure all .pde files are in the same folder
4. Make sure the assets/ folder is present
5. Click Run

Key Learning Outcomes:
⦁	Designing and implementing classes in Processing
⦁	Managing multiple objects using ArrayLists
⦁	Applying collision detection using distance calculations
⦁	Structuring a game using a continuous draw loop
⦁	Handling game state logic (running vs game over)

Possible Improvements:
⦁	Add score tracking
⦁	Increase difficulty over time
⦁	Add sound effects
⦁	Restart functionality after game over
